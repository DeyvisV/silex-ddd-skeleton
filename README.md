## Silex ddd skeleton

This is a simple project to improve my DDD skills and learn a little of Silex Php framework.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You must have installed docker on your local machine to run it easily. 
To install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installing
Open your command line interface and write:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will build the docker image and start needed container.

## Running the tests

Use the following command:

```bash
vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit
```

## Built with
* [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) - Microframework for PHP
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Dependencies management
* [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) - Front end framework
